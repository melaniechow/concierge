# Welcome! I am the Concierge

I based my helpdesk through the help of my classmate's helpdesks. I looked at some of the code, asked some students for the notes, and used that as a guideline to come up with the helpdesk. I'm not sure if I made any embellishments. Huge shout out to fictional eureka for having clear, understandable code (+ comments woah!)

Ticket had a rank to asses how it would be added. It also had a user + stub# to help identify the issuer. It also had variables of solution, problem, and a solved boolean. 

The helpdesk enqueues 3 tickets and then dequeues 3 tickets.
